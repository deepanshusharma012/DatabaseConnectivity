This project is based on Database connectivity in Java through JDBC to overwhelm the student and company details.

---- General JDBC program Introduction ----

A JDBC program comprises the following steps:

1. Allocate a Connection object, for connecting to the database server.
2. Allocate a Statement object, under the Connection created earlier, for holding a SQL command.
3. Write a SQL query and execute the query, via the Statement and Connection created.
4. Process the query result.
5. Close the Statement and Connection to free up the resources.
